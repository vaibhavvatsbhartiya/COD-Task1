This repository contains two tasks: a Todo application and a Weather application.

## Todo Application

The Todo application is designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. It includes features like adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, deleting tasks, and filtering tasks based on their completion status.

### Frontend Structure

The frontend for the Todo application is organized following an MVC architecture:

- **src** folder: Contains all source code related to the frontend.
  - **models** folder: Contains data models for Todo tasks.
  - **views** folder: Contains React components for UI rendering.
  - **controllers** folder: Contains logic for interacting with backend APIs.

### Backend Integration

The Todo application's backend functionality has been implemented and tested using Postman. To integrate the backend code with the frontend:

1. **API Endpoints**: Identify the API endpoints used by the backend for Todo CRUD operations.
2. **Axios or Fetch**: Use Axios (or Fetch API) in the frontend controllers to make HTTP requests to the backend API endpoints.
3. **Data Handling**: Implement data handling in the frontend controllers to manage data received from the backend (e.g., updating Todo list).
4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms in the frontend to handle cases where backend requests fail or return errors.
5. **Testing**: Test the integration thoroughly to ensure that frontend and backend communication works as expected.

The Todo application is ready to work; you just need to interact with the backend to enable full functionality.

## Weather Application

The Weather application provides users with weather information for their location or any specified location. It includes features like displaying current weather conditions, a 5-day weather forecast, and allowing users to search for weather information by location.

### Frontend Structure

The frontend for the Weather application is structured following an MVC architecture:

- **src** folder: Contains all source code for the frontend.
  - **models** folder: Contains data models for weather information.
  - **views** folder: Contains React components for UI rendering.
  - **controllers** folder: Contains logic for fetching weather data from RapidAPI.

### Backend Integration

The Weather application's backend functionality has been implemented, and it requires a RapidAPI key to fetch weather data. To integrate the backend code with the frontend:

1. **API Key**: Pass your RapidAPI key to the frontend controllers for fetching weather data.
2. **Axios or Fetch**: Use Axios (or Fetch API) in the frontend controllers to make HTTP requests to the RapidAPI endpoint for weather data.
3. **Data Handling**: Implement data handling in the frontend controllers to manage weather data received from RapidAPI.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms in the frontend to handle cases where weather data retrieval fails or returns errors.
5. **Future Updates**: Make any necessary changes or updates to the Weather application, ensuring that it works seamlessly with the backend.

By following these steps and ensuring MVC architecture adherence, both the Todo and Weather applications will function effectively, providing users with a smooth and reliable experience.

The only part is to integrate frontend and backend only thus it is converted into a FullStack(MERN) based application.
